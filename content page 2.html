                      Vaccines also appear to be less effective in preventing COVID-19 from the Beta variant. Recent studies suggest that mutations in the Beta variant's spike protein 
                      might allow it to escape the immune response trained by vaccines.</td>

                      Previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 appears to provide less protection against reinfection with the Gamma variant than other strains. However, at least one preprint study showed that the Gamma variant is less resistant to antibody responses 
                      from previous illness or vaccination than the Beta variant.</td>

                      preventing disease after two doses.</td>

          <p id="page3text1">Viruses constantly change through mutation and sometimes these mutations result in a new variant of the virus. Some variants emerge and disappear while others persist. New variants will continue to emerge. CDC and other public health organizations monitor all variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 in the United States and globally.
             Scientists monitor all variants but may classify certain ones as variants being monitored, variants of interest, variants of concern and variants of high consequence. Some variants spread more easily and quickly than other variants, which may lead to more cases of COVID-19. Even if a variant causes less severe disease in general, an increase 
             in the overall number of cases could cause an increase in hospitalizations, put more strain on healthcare resources and potentially lead to more deaths.</p>
