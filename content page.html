                <li>Covid-19 dies fast when exposed to the UV light of sunlight.</li>
                <li>Antibiotics don't work against Covid-19 because it is a virus while antibiotics only work with bacteria infections.</li>
                <li>Symptoms of Covid-19 starts from 5-6 days after the exposure.</li>
                <li>Isolation and Quarantine are not the same thing. Isolation means that you 
                    are isolated from other people because they have the virus, while quarantine means
                    that you are isolated from other people because you have close contact with someone with 
                    Covid-19.

                <li>Covid-19 can live on surfaces for days, but sometimes it depends on the object</li>

                    <p>We can see that it is tough to get affected by the Covid-19 virus.
                         It has many symptoms which will make us feel bad. The most common
                        symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness, loss of taste and smell, 
                        back pain, headache and many more. It also has long-term effects like 
                        long-term breathing problems, heart complications, chronic kidney impairment,
                        stroke and Guillain-Barre syndrome that is why we need to help each other, 
                        including ourselves. How can we do that? First is by following the health and
                        safety protocols like maintaining social distancing, wearing a mask, cleaning
                        your hands with water and soap, practicing cough etiquette. Second is to get 
                        vaccinated. We can always be sure that we won’t get severe cases when we’re
                        vaccinated. In this way, we can also make other people that are around us be
                        safe. </p>
