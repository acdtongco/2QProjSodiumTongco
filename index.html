      <p id="openingparagraph">The current outbreak is a test for all of us. It is time for us to do our part, work together and focus
        not only on what confronts us today, but plan for tomorrow, taking steps to protect every individual
        in order to minimize the health, social and economic impacts of COVID-19, and keep ourselves,
        families, communities and our country safe.
        We all know that keeping safe during the coronavirus is everyone's top priority. While most people
        may experience asymptomatic and mild symptoms, it's important to keep those who are more
        vulnerable safe. I really believe that sooner we can beat this pandemic COVID -19 by doing our
        part along with guidance from the CDC and public health officials. So what are you waiting for, act
        now and do your part by following these tips: Get a COVID-19 vaccine; wash your hands often
        with plain soap and water; cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others; avoid
        crowds and practice social distancing of at least one meter away from individuals experiencing
        respiratory symptoms; avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals, animal markets, and
        products that come from animals such as uncooked meat; skip handshakes and hugs, and
        practice cough etiquette.
        End this pandemic by keeping yourself and others safe: Do your part now!</p><br>

          <p id="textno2"> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
              Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
              recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require
              medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular
              disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. 
              Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.</p>
