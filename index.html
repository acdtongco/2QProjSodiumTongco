        <p id="p1">The current outbreak is a test for all of us. It is time for us to do our part, work together and focus
            not only on what confronts us today, but plan for tomorrow, taking steps to protect every individual
            in order to minimize the health, social and economic impacts of COVID-19, and keep ourselves,
            families, communities and our country safe.
            We all know that keeping safe during the coronavirus is everyone's top priority. While most people
            may experience asymptomatic and mild symptoms, it's important to keep those who are more
            vulnerable safe. I really believe that sooner we can beat this pandemic COVID -19 by doing our
            part along with guidance from the CDC and public health officials. So what are you waiting for, act
            now and do your part by following these tips: Get a COVID-19 vaccine; wash your hands often
            with plain soap and water; cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others; avoid
            crowds and practice social distancing of at least one meter away from individuals experiencing
            respiratory symptoms; avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals, animal markets, and
            products that come from animals such as uncooked meat; skip handshakes and hugs, and
            practice cough etiquette.
            End this pandemic by keeping yourself and others safe: Do your part now!</p>

            <p id="p2"> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
                Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
                recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require
                medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular
                disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. 
                Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.</p>
